<!-- towncrier release notes start -->

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-24

### Features

- Added backfilled entry support for sleep, nursing, bottle, solids, diaper, potty, and growth logging, including explicit timestamp APIs for completed historical entries. ([#11](https://github.com/Woyken/py-huckleberry-api/issues/11))
- Added activity logging, interval listing, and realtime listener support.
  Changed interval range APIs to accept datetime objects instead of Unix timestamp integers. ([#12](https://github.com/Woyken/py-huckleberry-api/issues/12))


## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Features

- Added pump tracking support with strict Firebase pump models, range queries, and real-time pump listeners. Pump entries can now be logged with `log_pump(...)`, total amounts are stored using the live app's split-per-side payload shape. ([#18](https://github.com/Woyken/py-huckleberry-api/issues/18))

### Bugfixes

- Allowed breastfeed intervals to omit `leftDuration` and `rightDuration`, so `list_feed_intervals(...)` can parse Firebase entries that do not store per-side durations. ([#25](https://github.com/Woyken/py-huckleberry-api/issues/25))


## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-12

### Bugfixes

- Updated required python to 3.14
  Marked `lastUpdated` property as optional, older entries might not have this field ([#20](https://github.com/Woyken/py-huckleberry-api/issues/20))


## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-10

### Bugfixes

- Align growth Firebase models and listener handling with the live app's imperial payload shape, including composite units like `lbs.oz`, while keeping imperial growth writes on the supported field set.


## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-08

### Bugfixes

- Allow empty Firebase `prefs.last*` summary maps to validate after a child's sleep, feeding, or diaper history has been cleared. ([#deleted-last-summary-payloads](https://github.com/Woyken/py-huckleberry-api/issues/deleted-last-summary-payloads))


## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-07

### Features

- Added `HuckleberryAPI.log_potty()` for potty events stored in the shared diaper tracker; potty changes are observed through the existing diaper listener. ([#potty-api](https://github.com/Woyken/py-huckleberry-api/issues/potty-api))
- Migrate the client to strict Firebase schema models, require an injected `aiohttp` websession, and remove the separate solids interval API path.
